Title: About

Since childhood I was fascinated with Mathematics and dreamed to become a teacher. Hence, I studied Mathematics at the [University of Belgrade](https://www.bg.ac.rs/en/) focusing on theoretical concepts. Following graduation in 2008, I taught Mathematics at the [High School of Economics](http://ekonomskazr.edu.rs/) in my hometown [Zrenjanin](http://www.zrenjanin.rs/en), however I have decided to continue with my education soon.

I received a scholarship for master’s program in Statistics at the [West University of Timisoara](https://www.uvt.ro/ro/), and become fascinated with Bayesian Statistics, while completing my thesis under the supervision of [Ilie Stan](https://www.info.uvt.ro/departament-matematica/) in 2010. In parallel, I worked as a SAS Analyst at [Cmed](https://cmedresearch.com/). Following graduation, I was granted a fellowship at the [University of Bucharest](https://unibuc.ro/?lang=en), for investigating theoretical backgrounds of Bayesian Statistics for analyzing biomedical data, collaborating with [Monica Dumitrescu](https://scholar.google.ro/citations?user=0vn1vMkAAAAJ&hl=ro) and had a pleasure to work for a short time in [Ingrid Van Keilegom’s](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00062045) group at the [Université Catholique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html). 

From 2012 to 2016, I was Research Assistant at the [Amsterdam University Medical Center](https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/research/organization/about-amsterdam-umc.htm), while conducting my PhD in [Mark van de Wiel’s](https://www.bigstatistics.nl/)  lab, developing methodology for integration of multi-omics time-series data. From 2016 to 2017, while finishing the thesis I studied Management at [FEEA](https://feaa.uvt.ro/en/), in Timisoara. In the fall of 2017, I joined Seven Bridges as a Bioinformatics Engineer, become a part of the team working on [Seven Bridges](https://www.sevenbridges.com/platform/) and [Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/) platforms. In the same time, I worked as a Visiting Lecturer and Researcher at the [Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy](https://www.umft.ro/en/acasa-english/) teaching Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, as well as, participating in the [PCE371 project](https://pce371.webs.com/) as a Bioinformatician. I completed my [doctoral thesis](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/comprehensive-molecular-characterisation-of-hpv-induced-transform) in Molecular Biostatistics in 2018 and received my degree from [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en). 

From 2019 to 2022, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computational Biology in [Dominik Lutter’s](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/ido/research/metabolism/computational-discovery-research/main-projects/index.html) lab at the [Institute of Diabetes and Obesity](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/ido/index.html), [Helmholtz Zentrum München](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/helmholtz-zentrum-muenchen/index.html), developing algorithms for multi-omics integration and single-cell data analysis, closely collaborating with biomedical scientists from [Cristina García-Cáceres’s](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/ido/research/neuroscience/astrocyte-neuron-networks/main-projects/index.html) and [Siegfried Ussar's](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/ido/research/metabolism/adipocytes-and-metabolism/main-projects/index.html) labs.
