Title: Research

Data stemming from complex cellular phenomena that have been characterised in many dimensions in order to understand interrelationships of the involved biomolecules and their functions, require developing novel methodology.
Together with many collaboration partners, my primary interest is in developing statistical machine learning methodology in order to study complex biological processes holistically, taking an integrative approach that combines multi-omics data where many cellular traits are interrogated simultaneously using the latest omics techniques.
Developing the methodology that covers a wide spectrum of univariate and multivariate statistics, focusing both on steady-state and time-series data, while relaying on Bayesian, frequentist, or a hybrid approach, depending on the nature of the problem at hand.
Employing developed methodology, borrowing knowledge from other fields and combining with state of the art tools allow me to analyse the data together with biomedical researchers addressing the problems in cancer or metabolism research.
