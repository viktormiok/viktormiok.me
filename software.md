title: Software

The software listed on this page was developed by me or it was created in the project I worked on. Software has been created as part of research projects that develop new methods for analysis and visualization, or as newer and efficient implementations of existing methods. On my [GitHub](https://github.com/viktormiok) page more functions and pipelines for analysing multi-omics data can be found. Softwares is developed as a R package, implementing the methods in R, with the help of other programming languages, like Python, C, C++.
